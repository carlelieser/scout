# Scout Prep

Interview preparation — company research, practice questions, STAR stories, and post-interview debriefs.

## Prerequisites

Requires:
- `~/.scout/profile/master-profile.md` — if missing, direct user to run `/scout-profile`
- Target job file in `~/.scout/jobs/` — if missing, direct user to run `/scout-find`

## Input

- **User specifies a job ID** → prep for that job
- **User specifies a mode** (research/practice/debrief) → use that mode
- **No job specified** → present list of jobs with status `"applied"` or `"interviewing"` for selection
- **No mode specified** → default to research mode

## Mode: Research (`/scout-prep` or `/scout-prep research`)

Generate a company research brief using `WebSearch`:

1. Search for the company: mission, products, founding year, size, funding, leadership team.
2. Search for recent news (last 6 months): product launches, funding rounds, partnerships, layoffs, leadership changes.
3. Identify key competitors.
4. Search Glassdoor/Blind/similar for sentiment (if findable): overall rating, common praise, common complaints.
5. Analyze the job listing language for culture signals (e.g., "fast-paced" = high workload, "wear many hats" = under-resourced, "collaborative" = meeting-heavy).

Save to `~/.scout/applications/<job-id>/interview-prep.md`:

```markdown

## Mode: Practice (`/scout-prep practice`)

Generate role-specific practice questions. Read the job listing and the user's master profile.

Append to `~/.scout/applications/<job-id>/interview-prep.md`:

```markdown
## Behavioral Questions

## Questions to Ask the Interviewer
- [About the team/role]
- [About the company/product]
- [About growth/culture]
- [About the specific challenges mentioned in the listing]
```

## Mode: Debrief (`/scout-prep debrief`)

After an interview, capture structured notes. Ask the user these questions one at a time:

1. Who interviewed you? (Name, title)
2. What went well?
3. What could have gone better?
4. Were there any questions you want to improve your answer for?
5. Any follow-up items? (Thank-you notes, additional materials requested, take-home assignments)
6. Overall impression — how do you feel about the role now?

Save to `~/.scout/applications/<job-id>/debrief.md` (append new entry if file exists — there may be multiple interview rounds):

```markdown
## Debrief: [Date]

**Interviewer(s):** [names and titles]

**Went well:**
- [point]

**Could improve:**
- [point]

**Questions to prep better:**
- [question]: [notes on better answer]

**Follow-up items:**
- [ ] Send thank-you to [name] by [date]
- [ ] [Other follow-ups]

**Overall impression:** [user's notes]
```

After capturing the debrief:
- Offer to draft thank-you emails for each interviewer
- Update the job file's `follow_up_date` to the thank-you deadline (24 hours from now)
- Append to `~/.scout/history.md`

## Re-run Behavior

- Research and practice modes update existing `interview-prep.md` content
- Debrief mode always appends a new timestamped entry (supports multiple rounds)
